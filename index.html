<h2>The Midnight Train</h2>

<p>
It was a foggy night in <b>Shimla</b>. The old railway station stood silent,
wrapped in cold mist. Aryan had missed the last train home and was forced
to wait alone on a wooden bench. The lights flickered, and the silence
felt heavier than the darkness itself.
</p>

<p>
Minutes passed… or maybe hours. He wasn’t sure.
That’s when he noticed something strange.
The <b>old clock on the wall was ticking backward</b>.
Each second pulled time in reverse.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, a <b>train whistle</b> echoed through the station.
No train was scheduled at this hour.
Yet through the fog, a faint train appeared,
its lights dim and unreal.
</p>

<p>
The doors opened slowly.
Something inside him forced his feet forward.
</p>

<p>
Inside the train, everything looked ancient.
Wooden seats. Rusted handles.
Every seat was empty—
except one.
</p>

<p>
A <b>small boy</b> sat silently, staring at him.
His eyes were hollow.
</p>

<p class="quote">
“Do you want to see what happens next?”
</p>

<p>
The train started moving.
Outside the window, Shimla twisted unnaturally.
Roads bent. Shadows moved.
Nothing felt real.
</p>

<p>
The train stopped.
Aryan stepped onto a platform he recognized.
His hometown.
But darker. Colder.
</p>

<p>
Then he saw it—
a figure across the platform
<b>wearing his own face</b>.
Smiling.
Waving.
</p>

<p>
Aryan ran.
Turned a corner—
</p>

<p>
And froze.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Shimla railway station</b> stood before him again.
The same fog.
The same bench.
The same backward clock.
</p>

<p>
He sat down.
The whistle echoed once more.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:crimson; font-size:20px;">
The loop had begun.
</p>
